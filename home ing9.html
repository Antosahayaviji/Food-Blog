            Step 1: Before you begin making the dough, grease oil on an Idli pan or a steamer pan and keep ready. <br> <br>
            Step 2: Heat a kadai or pan. Keep heat to low and add 1 cup (130 grams) rice flour.   <br><br>
            Step 3: On low heat, stirring often, roast the rice flour for 4 to 5 minutes. You don’t need to brown the flour. It’s just lightly roasted and this helps in making soft Idiyappams. <br><br>
            Step 4: In the same kadai or pan in which rice flour was roasted, add 1.25 to 1.3 cups water and ¼ teaspoon salt.  <br> <br>
            Step 5: Let the water come to a boil. The water has to be hot but should not be very hot. Do not allow it to come to a rolling boil. <br><br>
            Step 6: Add the hot water to the rice flour.  Begin to mix thoroughly with a spoon or spatula.  <br><br>
            Step 7: Keep on mixing and when the heat is tolerable, you can begin to knead. If you cannot knead, then wait for 1 to 2 minutes and when the heat is tolerable, then start kneading.   <br><br>
            Step 8:  Knead to a smooth and soft dough.
